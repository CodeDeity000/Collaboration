            <p>I usually find my projects and income through several freelance platforms. Over time, I've built a strong and trusted profile there with excellent reviews and great client feedback. These days, I don't really have to spend much time looking for work—clients often come to me directly after seeing my reviews and testimonials.</p>

        <h2>My Plan</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">A different approach to building a successful agency team</p>
        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <p>I have the plan to build an agency team with lots of clients and projects to support reliable and safe income sources.</p>
            <p>Of course, there are lots of agency teams around the world. They build their development teams, publish their websites, and market their skills to find clients and projects. But my concept is different from them. <strong>I believe it's the best efficient and powerful way to connect with clients who already have real, paid projects to offer</strong>, rather than spending time on marketing.</p>
            <p>I think the most important thing is to connect with clients who already have real, paid projects to offer. That way, we don't have to spend time pitching ideas or trying to sell something—we simply use our skills to deliver what they need. It's a straightforward and respectful exchange: they bring the project and the budget, and we focus on doing our best work.</p>
            <div class="card-list" style="margin-top: 24px;">
              <div class="card">
                <h3>The Traditional Approach</h3>
                <p>Build a website, create marketing materials, pitch ideas, and try to sell services. This takes time and doesn't always guarantee clients with real budgets.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="card">
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>

            <h4>Why This Works Better</h4>
            <p>By focusing on clients who already have real, paid projects, we eliminate the uncertainty. We don't have to convince anyone—we just deliver quality work on projects that are already funded.</p>

          <h3>The Way to Handle the Plan</h3>
          <p>There are many job marketplaces with millions of clients who already have projects they want to develop. These clients are looking for developers, and if we can connect with them effectively, we can receive projects directly from them. By communicating with clients, sharing our skills, and understanding the requirements of their projects, we can secure paid work and receive the budget offered on these contracts.</p>
